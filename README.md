### Description 

- This exercise uses four images of the classic PacMan as shown above.

- Each set has two images - one with mouth open and the another with mouth closed.

- Flipping between values 0 and 1 helps the PacMan to change direction.

- The same is used for simulation of PacMan opening and closing mouth.

- Run() function is called on mouse click and every time it is called, it updates the PacMan image, position and direction on the screen.

- setInterval() will call the Run() function every 200 milliseconds to keep it going. 
  
- checkPageBounds function allow PacMan to reverse his trajectory once the PacMan hits the edge of the screen on the x-axis.



### To Run this Program

In order to run this file,  

- Fork and Clone the repository to your local machine.

- Drag and drop index.html file in a browser tab.

### Future RoadMap

This project can be still be enhanced by 

- making the pacman to randomly change velocity.

- making more pacmen.
